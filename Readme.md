I have install the package i.e. bouncy checkbox for toggling up in task complete and incomplete, but here I am having issue when the task is added up in form, the status is changed into complete and added, but even though the status value is changed the checkbox doesn't get updated and return back to incomplete stage (behind the scene the value is false but checkbox is still checked). 

Professor, please set up a zoom meeting because I want to know what is an issue.
